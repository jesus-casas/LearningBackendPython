# LearningBackendPython

## Description
This repository is a personal journey of documenting my learning process for backend development using Python. 
I am following the curriculum from boot.dev to deepen my understanding of backend concepts, best practices, and real-world applications. 
As I progress, I'll be sharing code snippets, notes, and projects to not only track my own growth but also to help others who might be on a similar path. Some examples from boot.dev.
